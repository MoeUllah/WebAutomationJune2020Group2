    //Start from HomePage add the WebElement(s) for the page with the methods of those elements. Add more pages as your
    //module needs along the way like Mafi bhai. Try to connect one page to the next as well.
    //Very important:
    //1) Go to every module and change the OS if your mac to "OS X", if windows to "Windows" under the
    // runner.xml file.
    //2) For mac users the driver path in CommonAPI works with one dot, for Windows it works with 2 dots(Windows can
    //leave as is since I'm Windows. Mac change to one dot. Also you need to go to the connectoToSQLDatabase
    //class and also change to one dot for the path for mac users. For windows its set to two already, no worries.
    //The chromedriver is for chrome 84 if you got compatiblity issues follow and get the correct
    // browser-to-driver compatibility.
    //3) Under secret.properties file put your mySQL credentials: user, password and name of your database.
    //4) Continue to build your pages and connect some to others, test with assertions under AllFunctionality
    // class(just
    //add to it). Once done run the xmlrunner.
    //5)For mysql you can have compatibility issues, make sure if you have mySQL 8.0 you havew the connector jar to
    // 8.0 as well,
    //if you clone this it should be good.
    //6)Ill fix up the database part and excel. But for database to retrieve from database you need to make your
    //own methods based on the object you are trying to get if any.
